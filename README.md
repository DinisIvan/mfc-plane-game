# PlaneGame-MFC  
MFC version of Airplane Wars! The MFC aircraft battle completed by the comprehensive practice of programming, no MFC foundation, a rookie.
Realized the functions of multi-level, multi-life, blood bar, mana value, boss and blood bar, pause and restart, invincible mode, fighter ultimate move, fighter upgrade, shield, blood pack, background music and scrolling, fighter frame
animation As a result, the operation is relatively stable, and occasionally there are some
bugs that are not very clear. After all, I am new to MFC, and I am not familiar with the API. It has been debugged for a long time, and it is okay hahaha.
